This project is a login boiler plate for Play! apps. 

The boiler plate includes:

1. Facebook login
2. Twitter login
3. Github login
4. Username/password login

The user can link all of these accounts together and will be identified as one single user (after he has linked his accounts). 

Note: This is my first scala project. Since I come from java, I am sure I would have written java in scala. 

Play version: 2.2.x
Scala version: 2.10.x
SecureSocial: master-SNAPSHOT (Does not work with 2.1.3. Should work with anything that will be released)
MySQL: 5.6.x
